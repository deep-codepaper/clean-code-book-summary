#Clean Coding Technique - Meaningful Names

##Description

In this learning session, I explored the clean coding technique of using meaningful names for variables, methods, classes, constants, and files. I learned various strategies and principles that can help make our codebase more readable and maintainable.

###Intention-Revealing Names: 

I discovered the importance of choosing names that clearly communicate the purpose and functionality of the entity they represent. By using descriptive and precise names, we can make our code more self-explanatory and reduce the need for additional comments.

###Avoiding Disinformation: 

I learned how to avoid names that can mislead or confuse other developers. By steering clear of ambiguous terms or misleading prefixes/suffixes, we can prevent misunderstandings and improve code comprehension.

###Making Meaningful Distinctions: 

I understood the significance of differentiating similar entities through meaningful naming. By adding distinguishing words or using more specific terms, we can eliminate ambiguity and enhance code clarity.

###Pronounceable Names: 

I discovered the benefits of selecting names that are easy to pronounce and discuss among team members. Having pronounceable names promotes effective communication and collaboration within the development team.

###Searchable Names: 

I explored techniques for choosing names that are easily searchable within codebases or development tools. By using consistent naming conventions and avoiding abbreviations, we can quickly locate and understand code elements.

###Avoiding Encoding: 

I learned about the drawbacks of encoding information in names, such as adding prefixes or suffixes that convey unnecessary details. Instead, I discovered the importance of using names that focus on the entity's purpose or behavior.

###Avoiding Mental Mapping: 

I understood the concept of avoiding names that require excessive mental effort to understand or relate to their purpose. By choosing clear and unambiguous names, we can minimize the cognitive load on developers and improve code comprehension.

By applying these principles and strategies, I learned how to select meaningful names that contribute to the readability, maintainability, and overall quality of the codebase.
